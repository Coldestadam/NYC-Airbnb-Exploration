# NYC-Airbnb-Exploration

## Data Exploration
I used Pandas to explore the relationships between the different variables in the dataset. Especially the differences between
boroughs of New York City

## Linear Regression
I developed a Ridge Regression Model and a Linear Regression Model to predict the price of the Airbnb listings. I used the 
Linear Regression model to explore what features lead the price of the listings to increase or decrease.
